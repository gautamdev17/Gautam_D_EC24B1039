🔍 Project: Electricity Bill Prediction using Machine Learning

📁 Dataset:
  - electricity_bill_dataset.csv
  - Contains:
    • Appliance counts (Fan, AC, TV, etc.)
    • MonthlyHours (electricity usage duration)
    • TariffRate (price per unit)
    • City and Company info
    • Target variable: ElectricityBill

🧠 Models Tested & Their R² Scores:
  1. ✅ Random Forest Regressor       → 0.9999755665317055  ✅ Best Model
  2. 🌳 Decision Tree Regressor       → 0.9999118343410605
  3. 📉 Linear Regression             → 0.9956378681437017

📐 Feature Engineering Done:
  - `totalAppliances` = sum of all 6 appliance columns
  - `CostPerAppliance` = ElectricityBill / totalAppliances
  - `IsSummer` (binary: 1 if month is Mar–May) → removed, as it reduced performance

📊 Evaluation Metrics:
  - R² Score → measures model accuracy (closer to 1 = better)
  - RMSE     → how far predictions deviate from actual values

📈 Visualizations Included:
  - Actual vs Predicted Scatter Plot
  - Correlation Heatmap (Top 10 features excluding approx_monthly_bill)

🛠️ Tools Used:
  - Python
  - pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
  - scikit-learn

🚀 Final Model:
  - **Random Forest Regressor**
  - Reason: Highest R² score, handles nonlinear patterns, automatically captures feature interactions (like Fan × TariffRate)
