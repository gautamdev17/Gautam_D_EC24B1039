## ‚ú® Feature Engineering

We created new features to help models learn better relationships.

### üîß Custom Features

- `totalAppliances`: total number of appliances in the house  
  ```python
  df["totalAppliances"] = df[['Fan', 'Refrigerator', 'AirConditioner', 'Television', 'Monitor', 'MotorPump']].sum(axis=1)
